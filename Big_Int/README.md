# Big Integers
#### Written by: Joshua Revilla

This program takes a string of a long number and turns it into a representatation that allows for arithmetic operations.


### Files:

1. List.h<br/>
contains the function prototypes for all List functions and
the struct definiton

2. List.cpp<br/>
contains the implementations for the List functions 

3. ListTest.cpp<br/>
contains a quick test for the List ADT

4. BigInteger.h<br/>
contains function prototypes for the BigInteger ADT and 
the struct definition

5. BigInteger.cpp<br/>
contains the implementations for the BigInteger functions

6. BigIntegerTest.cpp<br/>
contains a quick test for the BigInteger ADT

7. Arithmetic.cpp<br/>
contains the `main()` function and is the main
client function for the ADT in this project. 
program performs arithemetic operations on `BigIntegers`

8. Makefile<br/>
contains build insturctions for the Sparse program.
use `make` to build ./Arithmetic

#### Usage:

> `./Arithmetic <infile> <outfile>`
